# Magica - symbolic calculator "made by" ChatGPT

## What it is
A symbolic calculator REPL that works both as calculator and as expression simplifier.
Very crude for now, but can do this:

```
> 1+1
Result: 2
> x+x
Result: 2 * x
```

## How it's made
Every line of java code is written by ChatGPT 4 through the web interface.
The AI has of course been heavily supervised and guided in its effort,
and a human has made all the actual edits in the editor.
The full log of interaction between the human and ChatGPT is recorded in the file `chatgpt.log`

## How to run
Run the `Magica` class.
